### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have rejoined after I lost my beloved account, [roramigator](https://github.com/roramigator), I blame GitHub alone and I am very disappointed for all the lack of support from their part; the link on my profile is the reason. It really did hurt because I had work hard to build it ([Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20220730204819/https://github.com/roramigator)) but I'm glad for this experience, who told me that trusting in a proprietary, trade-secret system service was a good idea?
